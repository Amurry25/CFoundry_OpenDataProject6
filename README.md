# CFoundry_OpenDataProject6

#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 6 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program. Where in this particular achievement I was tasked with selecting my "own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring." With the results of my analyses being visualized and "presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard." For my data set I choose **The World Happiness Report** from 2015 to 2019.

#### Objective
> "The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness."

### Additional context
> I choose this data set because on a personal level I've always been fascinated by human behavior. And as a result I love spending time gaining insights that allow me to better understand how people think, why people believe certain ideas and why they make the decisions that they do. Because in the same way that gaining more context about one individual’s life has value, learning about what people think allows me to in a sense see ideas through their eyes.

#### Key Questions asked by Instacart
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
