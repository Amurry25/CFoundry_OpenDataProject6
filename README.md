# CFoundry_OpenDataProject6

#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 6 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program. Where in this particular achievement I was tasked with selecting my "own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring." With the results of my analyses being visualized and "presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard." For my data set I choose **The World Happiness Report** from 2015 to 2019.

#### Objective
> "The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness."

#### Additional context
> I choose this data set because on a personal level I've always been fascinated by human behavior. And as a result I love spending time gaining insights that allow me to better understand how people think, why people believe certain ideas and why they make the decisions that they do. Because in the same way that gaining more context about one individualâ€™s life has value, learning more about what people think allows me to in a sense see the world through their eyes. Which at least for me allows me to better understand and empathize with them; as well as better understand myself and my ideals.
