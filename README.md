# CFoundry_OpenDataProject6

#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 6 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program. Where in this particular achievement I was tasked with selecting my "own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring." With the results of my analyses being visualized and "presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard." For my data set I choose **The World Happiness Report** from 2015 to 2019.

#### Objective
> "The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness."

#### Additional context
> I choose this data set because on a personal level I've always been fascinated by human behavior. And as a result I love spending time gaining insights that allow me to better understand how people think, why people believe certain ideas and why they make the decisions that they do. Because in the same way that gaining more context about one individualâ€™s life has value, learning more about what people think allows me to in a sense see the world through their eyes. Which at least for me allows me to better understand and empathize with them; as well as better understand myself and my ideals. 

#### Data Sets Provided 
- **Data Source** - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness) 
- **Data Profile** --> World Happiness Report (2015-2016)
  - Country
  - Region
  - Happiness Rank
  - Happiness Score
  - Economy (GDP per Capita)
  - Family (Social Support)
  - Health (Life Expectancy)
  - Freedom
  - Trust (Government Corruption)

#### Tools
- The following Python libraries were used:
  - numpy - for working with arrays
  - pandas - for data analytics
  - scipy - to calculate mathematical problems
  - matplotlib - for visualization and graphical plotting
  - matplotlib.pyplot as plt - for visualization and graphical plotting
  - seaborn - for visualization
  - sklearn - for data analytics
  - quandl - for data analytics of financial and economic data

#### Content
In this project folder you will find, a business-like folder structure containing the important files of the project:

1. "01 Project Management" - this is an example folder, since there is no project client.

2. "02 Data" - here you would find the datasets/-frames used and changed. However, since this project is published under my GitHub profile, this folder is empty. The original data sources can be found in the notebooks.

3. "03 Scripts" - here you can find the scripts created for the project. There are 6 notebooks/scripts:

 > 6.1 which is about the sourcing and cleaning of the datasets.
 6.2 which is about exploring relationships and correlations.
 6.3 which is about a geospatial analysis using folium and json libraries for python.
 6.4 which is about autoregression (linear regression) using the sklearn library for python.
 6.5 which is about clustering (kmean) using the sklearn library for python.
 6.6 which is about time series forecasting (ARMA and ARIMA) using the statsmodel library for python.

4. "04 Analysis" - here all visualizations created with matplotlib, seabron and pyplot can be found. (Sorted by the a folder pattern similar to the one in "03 Scripts".

5. "05 Sent to Client" - this is an example folder, since there is no project client.
