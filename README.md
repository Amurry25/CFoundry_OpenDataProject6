# CFoundry_OpenDataProject6

#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 6 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program. Where in this particular achievement I was tasked with selecting my "own data-set to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring." With the results of my analysis being visualized and "presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard." Then lastly, in terms of my data-set I choose to analyze **The World Happiness Report** from 2015 to 2019.

#### Objective
> "The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness."

#### Additional context
> I choose this data set because on a personal level I've always been fascinated by human behavior. And as a result I love spending time gaining insights that allow me to better understand how people think, why people believe certain ideas and why they make the decisions that they do. Because in the same way that gaining more context about one individualâ€™s life has value, learning more about what people think allows me to in a sense see the world through their eyes. Which at least for me allows me to better understand and empathize with them; as well as better understand myself and my ideals. 

#### Data Sets Used 
- **Data Source** - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)

  - Country
  - Region
  - Happiness Rank
  - Happiness Score
  - Economy (GDP per Capita)
  - Family (Social Support)
  - Health (Life Expectancy)
  - Freedom
  - Trust (Government Corruption)

#### Tools
- The following Python libraries were used:
  - numpy - for working with arrays
  - pandas - for data analytics
  - scipy - to calculate mathematical problems
  - matplotlib - for visualization and graphical plotting
  - matplotlib.pyplot as plt - for visualization and graphical plotting
  - seaborn - for visualization
  - sklearn - for data analytics
  - quandl - for data analytics of financial and economic data

#### Content
In this repository you will find, five different folders each containing different files I created while completing this project:

1. "**01 Project Management**" - This folder, contains the project brief for this exercise.

2. "**02 Data**" - This folder, contains the original and prepared data sets used for this project. 

3. "**03 Scripts**" - Here you can find the scripts created for the project.
  - The folder, contains 6 notebooks/scripts:
    - 6.1 "Sourcing Open Data".
    - 6.2 "Exploring Relationships" and correlations.
    - 6.3 "Geographical Visualizations with Python".
    - 6.4 "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression".
    - 6.5 "Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering".
    - 6.6 "Sourcing & Analyzing Time Series Data".

4. "**04 Analysis**" - This folder, contains visualizations created with matplotlib, seabron and pyplot via Python. 

5. "**05 Sent to Client**" - This folder, contains a downloadable Tableau download containing the final storyboard presentation; along with all the visualizations used to create said presentation.
